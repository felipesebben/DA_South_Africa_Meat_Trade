# Project – Data Analysis of South Africa’s meat imports.
This project seeks to analyze **South Africa’s trade profile**. Particularly, it aims at understanding the composition of the country’s meat imports. 
As an important African market, getting a more nuanced view of South African demand could help companies to  define which products are likely to be sold there and to compare local prices with other markets to see the sale is worth. Hence, this project will try to answer the following questions:

1.	What are South Africa’s overall import trends in recent years?
    - In prices and volume?
    - Has it gone up?
    - How much and how many?
2.	What are the main imported goods in quantity and value?
    -	What price?
    -	What quantity?
    -	Has it changed over the years?
    -	What is the trend?
3.	What are the main exporting countries?
    -	What do they export?
    -	What price?
    -	Has this list changed over the years? 
    -	What is the trend?
